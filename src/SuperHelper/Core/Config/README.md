3. Module `module_config.py`: Contains the configuration loader and saver for all modules.

## API documentation

1. Function `load_app_config()`

* **Parameters**:

  * `config_path`: The path to config file

    The path will be retrieved from the environment variable `SUPER_HELPER_CONFIG_PATH` if it is set. Otherwise, the
    default path is
    `Pathlib.Path.home() / ".super_helper"`

* **Returns**: *None*

* **Raises**:

  * `OSError` if either the path provided by environment variable `SUPER_HELPER_CONFIG_PATH` is a folder, or the config
    file does not exist at all, or is unreadable.

  * `JSONDecodeError` if the JSON document is invalid, or likely corrupted.

* **Note**: This function is intended for internal use only. It should only be called once when the application
  starts. (Called by Core CLI)


2. Function `save_app_config()`

* **Parameters**:

  * `config_path`: The path to config file

    The path will be retrieved from the environment variable `SUPER_HELPER_CONFIG_PATH` if it is set. Otherwise, the
    default path is
    `Pathlib.Path.home() / ".super_helper"`

* **Returns**: *None*

* **Raises**:

  * `OSError` if either the path provided by environment variable `SUPER_HELPER_CONFIG_PATH` is a folder, or the
    existing config file there is un-writable.

  * This function will not raise `JSONEncodeError` if there are non JSON-serializable values. Instead, it will be
    default to `None`.

* **Note**: This function is intended for internal use only. It should only be called once when the application ends. (
  Called by Core CLI)


3. Function `load_cli_config()`

* **Parameters**: *No parameter*

* **Returns**: The `CORE_CLI` section of the application configuration.

* **Note**: This function is intended for internal use only. It should only be called once when the application starts
  loading modules.
  (Called by the Core module loader)


4. Function `save_cli_config()`

* **Parameters**:

  * `config`: The configuration of CLI core

    This configuration is likely the CLI configuration returned by `load_cli_config()` after modifying its items.

* **Returns**: *None*

* **Note**: This function is intended for internal use only. It should only be called once when the application starts
  loading modules.
  (Called by the Core module loader)


5. Function `load_module_config()`

* **Parameters**:

  * `module_name`: The name of the module.

    It is highly recommended that the module will use its qualified name of the ***subpackage*** to maintain
    consistency.

* **Returns**: The configuration section of the module.

  If the module is run for the first time, this function will return an empty dict `dict()`. It might be saved into the
  application config when passed to `save_module_config()` with the same `module_name` provided.

* **Note**: All modules are not allowed to implement its own configuration handler. Modules must retrieve the
  configuration for themselves using this function, and save it using `save_module_config()` with the same `module_name`
  .


6. Function `save_module_config()`

* **Parameters**:

  * `module_name`: The name of the module.

    It is highly recommended that the module will use its qualified name of the ***subpackage*** to maintain
    consistency.

  * `config`: The configuration of the module.

    This configuration must be a `dict` and contains JSON-serializable items only. Non JSON-serializable items are
    serialized as `None`, which may lead to data loss if not used properly.

* **Returns**: *None*

* **Note**: All modules are not allowed to implement its own configuration handler. Modules must save its configuration
  using this function.
