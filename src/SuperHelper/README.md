# Package `SuperHelper`

This package contains so many useful CLI utilities!

## Package content

1. Subpackage `SuperHelper.Core`: Contains the implementation of core CLI.

2. Subpackage `SuperHelper.Modules`: Contains the implementation of built-in modules.

3. Subpackage `SuperHelper.Tests`: Contains the test suites for any components that require automatic testing.

## API documentation

The main package does not contain any API. However, there are some useful application-wide variables:

1. Variable `Version` (and `__version__`)

   This variable is where the application can collect the version information from. Version is incremented here.
